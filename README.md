# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this project we could choose between three different interest areas, sensors, API's and Multiscreen. We were supposed to creat an app with React Native by using styled components. I chose to go with the API-project.

## The problem

I felt that it was very difficult to start with this project because it was so open with no design to follow. I looked at some older projects to get inspiration and decided at first to get som facts about cats through an API I found, but I could not make it work and unfortunatly I had very limited time for the project this week because of illness in the family so I decided to go with a very "basic coding" and found an API with cute cat images to use. When I got the code to work I tried to implement a component to be able to share the images and used a component from reactnative.dev but didn't get it to work. If I had had more time I would have tried to make the share-function to work or maybe tried the sensor project instead!

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
